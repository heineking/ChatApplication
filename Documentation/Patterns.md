## Patterns ##

I created this application to also explore the use of different OOP patterns. Some of these patterns are "overkill" but the goal of this project is more educational than realism.

In past projects for work I have unfortunately needed to coordinate syncing data between different databases. Typically this was a syncing between the application database and a CRM database.

I used the Chat Application to explore how to intercept the DAL and do the appropriate writes and reads from another data source.
